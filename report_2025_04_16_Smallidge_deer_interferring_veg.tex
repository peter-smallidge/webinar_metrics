\cellcolor{gray!10}{Agency or institution} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{Try to educate participants better on invasive management}\\

\cellcolor{gray!10}{Agency or institution} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{Identifying forested areas that have the most prevalence of interfering vegetation.}\\

\cellcolor{gray!10}{Forester} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{continue to address vegetation impact of forests}\\
\midrule
Forester & look for deer impacts prior to forest management planning\\
\midrule\\
\cellcolor{gray!10}{Forester} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{serious comment-I will have to learn a lot more about woods a few years after we have used them to control undesirable vegetation. Specifically, I need to be more aware of what was present before, right after goats were done, and then, say, 2-3 years later. We may be changing to a worse vegetation species to control and not know iabout it until much later when it is too late.}\\
\midrule
Forester & Deer Exclusion Fencing Trial\\
\midrule\\
\addlinespace
\cellcolor{gray!10}{Forester} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{Do a more complete analysis of the invasive issues on my woodlot. Last year I sadly put Newfane, Vermont  on the EAB map as when we logged last winter I stripped the bark off some 4"-8" upper limbs and sure enough under the bark was the telltale "S" shaped curved minings in the cambial layer... However neither of these two infested trees had shown any "blonding."  Each year during all 4 seasons,  I examined my 3 big ash (now down to the last one- 23"dbh, with 4 perfect 10 or 11' veneer bolts}\\

\midrule\\
\cellcolor{gray!10}{Forester} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{Would like to try a Fecon treatment.}\\

\midrule\\
\cellcolor{gray!10}{Forester} & \cellcolor{gray!10}{We have a contract with EQIP for 87 acres of understory "brush management", involving chemical treatment of striped maple, hophornbeam, and beech.  The webinar clarified that without protecting desirable regeneration from deer browsing this treatment may be useless, so I will look (again) for a way to finance and implement fencing, tree tubes, or some other method of protecting regeneration from deer browse.}\\
